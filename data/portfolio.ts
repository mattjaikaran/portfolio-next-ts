export const aboutData = `
<p>
I am <strong>Matt Jaikaran</strong>, a software engineer based in New York City with a unique background bridging technology and creative industries.
</p>
<p>
My journey began in Nashville's music industry, where I worked as a touring musician, songwriter, and producer while developing expertise in marketing, branding, and artist management. This experience taught me the value of creativity, attention to detail, and effective collaboration.
</p>
<p>
In 2016, I made a strategic pivot to software engineering, relocating to NYC and immersing myself in technology through a coding bootcamp. Since then, I've built a robust career in full-stack development, working across the entire software lifecycle from design to deployment.
</p>
<p>
I specialize in modern web development using JavaScript/TypeScript and Python, constantly exploring new technologies and methodologies to optimize development workflows. My diverse background allows me to bring both technical expertise and creative problem-solving to every project.
</p>
<p>
I'm always open to discussing new opportunities and collaborations, whether they're innovative software projects or creative technical ventures.

The initial version was architected as a monolithic application using Django 3 and Vue.js, establishing a strong foundation for the product. For version 2.0, I designed and implemented a complete rebuild, transitioning to a more scalable and modern tech stack. This included upgrading to Django 4 for a robust backend API and adopting Next.js with TypeScript for an enhanced frontend experience. The new architecture leverages Redux Toolkit and RTK Query for efficient state management, resulting in improved performance and maintainability. Throughout both versions, I implemented comprehensive testing strategies using Cypress and PyTest to ensure reliability.',
